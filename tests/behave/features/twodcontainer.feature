#  TwoDResponseConteiner class functionality

Feature: TwoDResponseContainer should store TwoDSpectra index by various methods
    TwoDResponse container should be able to index its content by integer values,
    by arbitrary ValueAxis (including TimeAxis) and by a list of strings 
    (like a dictionary). It can perform Fourier transform in its content if
    it is indexed by ValueAxis, TimeAxis of FrequencyAxis.
    
    
    Scenario Outline: TwoDResponseContainer indexes by an integer number
        Given that I have <N> TwoDResponse objects
        And I have an empty TwoDResponse container
        When I set the container to accept indexing by integers
        And I add the spectra to the container one by one
        Then TwoDResponse can be retrieved using the index <i>
        But when index is out of bounds, I get an exception
        
    Examples:
    | N  |  i  |
    | 1  |  0  |
    | 20 |  8  |
    | 12 |  12 |
    | 9  |  3  |


    Scenario Outline: TwoDResponseContainer indexes by ValueAxis
        Given that I have <N> TwoDResponse objects
        And I have an empty TwoDResponse container
        And I have a ValueAxis of lenght <N> starting from zero with certain <step>
        When I set the container to accept index by ValueAxis
        And I add the spectra to the container using values from ValueAxis
        Then TwoDResponse can be retrieved using values <val> from ValueAxis
        But when values are out of bounds, I get an exception
        And TwoDResponse can be retrieved using the index <i>
        But when index is out of bounds, I get an exception
        
    Examples:
    |  N  |  step  |  val   |  i   |
    |  5  |   0.3  |  0.9   |  4   |
    | 12  |   1.0  |  10.0  |  4   |

        But when values are out of bounds, I get an exception
        And TwoDResponse can be retrieved using the index <i>
        But when index is out of bounds, I get an exception

    | 12  |   1.0  |  10.0  |  4   |
    | 12  |   1.0  |  15.0  |  5   |
    | 15  |   2.0  |  16.0  |  10  |
    | 15  |   2.0  |  18.0  |  20  |


    Scenario Outline: TwoDResponseContainer indexes by FrequencyAxis
        Given that I have <N> TwoDResponse objects

    |  N  |  step  |  val   |  i   |
    |  5  |   0.3  |  0.9   |  4   |

        But when values are not in the list of strings, I get an exception
        And TwoDResponse can be retrieved using the index <i>
        But when index is out of bounds, I get an exception

        Given that I have a TwoDResponseContainer containing <N> spectra indexed by ValueAxis
        When I calculate Fourier transform on the container
