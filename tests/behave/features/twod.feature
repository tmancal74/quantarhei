Feature: TwoDResponse can store data in different level of details.
    There is a hierarchy of storage. The lowest level detail (highest resolution) is represented by
    individual Liouville pathways. When in the mode of storing pathways,
    each spectrum is store with pathways character "R1g", "R2f", etc. and
    with a unique tag. Individual pathways can be retrieved using tags, and
    spectra corresponding to group of pathways, such as "ESA", "GSB", etc. or
    "total", "rephasing_2D_signal", "nonrephasing_2D_signal" can be calculated.

        Given that I have data corresponding to individual Liouville pathways in 2D spectrum
