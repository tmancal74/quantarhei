# Tests of the mutual relation of the correlation functions and spectral densities
#
# Correlation functions and spectral densities can be specified by a corresponding set of parameters,
# and, usually, only one of the two can be given by a simple formula. The other of the two
# has to be calculated numerically. 
#
# In these tests we test the mutual consistency of the classes representing correlation functions
# and spectral density. 
#
# The following two relations have to be tested:
#
# 1) When spectral density is specified for positive frequencies (the function is odd), one can obtain
# a Fourier transform of the correlation function by multiplying the spectral density by a 
# factor containing temperature. By inverse Fourier transform we can obtain correlation function
#
# 2) When correlation function is speciefied, the Fourier transform of its imagonary part gives
# the spectral density. 
#
# The two relations can be achieved analytically, when formulae are known, or numerically in the case
# that they are not known. Consistency of the numerics can and should be tested on the analytical
# results


Feature: Spectral density and correlation function relations

    Spectral density and correlation function are related by Fourier transform,
    and it should be possible to create the objects representing them from one another
