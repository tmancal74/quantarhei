There is Quantum Mechanics behind Quantarhei
============================================

Molecular and aggregate objects in Quantarhei form the layer closest to the
user. Below this layer there is a layer describing quantum mechanics of the
problem. In quantum mechanics of open system we deal with operators and 
superoperators, which are very happy about being treated as objects. 
Especially, the fact that an abstract object is independent of its mathematical
representation (the basis of representation) is well represented by the 
idea of object in programming languages.
