Quantarhei Management Classes
=============================

Some of the management classes, e.g. the main manager class `Manager`,
are available at user level

.. code:: python

    import quantarhei as qr
    
    print(qr.Manager().version)
    
Other management classes are considered Quantarhei internals and should not be
accessed directly, unless you really know what you are doing.
