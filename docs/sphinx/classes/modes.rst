Intramolecular Vibrational Modes
================================

Intramolecular vibrational modes are represented by two classes. The **Mode**
class is a user class for creation of intramolecular modes. The **SubMode** 
class is a class for internal use, which keeps track of differences of the
parameters of the same intramolecular mode with respect to different 
electronic states of the molecule.


Details of the two classes can be found below:
