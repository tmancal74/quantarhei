Molecule
========

The **Molecule** class represents the basic quantum objects of interest in
**Quantarhei**, namely, the molecules. For Quantarhei, molecule is a 
multilevel quantum system with electronic gaps in the optical region of
frequencies. As of version 0.0.67, Quantarhei can reliably handle only molecules
with two electronic states, the ground state and one excited state, however,
the work on extension to more excited states is well under way.
