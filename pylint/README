We follow the coding style recommendation PEP 008 as implemented by pylint

The following exeptions are followed consciously and corresponding
settings are made in the pylintrc file 

1) number of allowed arguments in function calls is increased to 10 in [DESIGN]
   section of the rc file

# Maximum number of arguments for function / method
max-args=10

2) names of methods are allowed to look like this:

   get_FrequencyAxis()

   Here we are asking an object to return an object of the FrequencyAxis type

   The following is set in the [BASIC] section of the rc file

# Regular expression matching correct method names
method-rgx=[a-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]{2,30}$

# Naming hint for method names
method-name-hint=[a-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]{2,30}$

3) We add variable names: n, kBT to the good allowed variable names

# Good variable names which should always be accepted, separated by a comma
good-names=i,j,k,n,ex,Run,_,kBT

4) 
# Maximum number of attributes for a class (see R0902).
max-attributes=10
